# Implementing Genetic Algorithm for Feature Optimization

<b><h3>KNAPSACK PROBLEM</h3></b>
The Knapsack problem helps in achieving Local optimized problem, but Genetic Algorithm helps in achieving Global optimized problem. The main motive behind implementing this project is to optimize the feature selection.

<b><h3>PROCESSES:</h3></b>

<b><h4>Mutation:</h4></b>

Mutation is the part of the GA which is related to the “exploration” of the search space. It has been observed that mutation is essential to the convergence of the GA while crossover is not.

<b><h4>Crossover:</h4></b>

The crossover operator is analogous to reproduction and biological crossover. In this more than one parent is selected and one or more off-springs are produced using the genetic material of the parents. Crossover is usually applied in a GA with a high probability
